I am the M. Christian Mitchell Associate Professor in Real Estate and Economics at the University of Alabama. My research strives to improve urban transportation systems by focusing on three broad themes: first, understanding and addressing traffic congestion, second, evaluating the impacts of new transportation technologies on cities, and third, improving transportation safety. My research uses a variety of theoretical and empirical methods, including structural and reduced-form approaches, to address these themes. My work has been published in leading academic journals including *Science*, the *Journal of the European Economics Association*, the *International Economic Review*, and *Transportation Research Part B*, and covered by media outlets including *the Wall Street Journal*, *The Economist*, *The Atlantic*, *Bloomberg*, *The Telegraph* (United Kingdom), and *CBC* (Canada). My work has been honored by the Sakip Sabanci International Research Award, the Best Dissertation Award by the Transportation and Public Utilities Group, and the Best Paper Award at the Kumho-Nectar Conference on Transportation Economics. I received my B.A. from Brigham Young University and my M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Before coming to the University of Alabama, I worked at Northwestern University and the University of Toronto.
