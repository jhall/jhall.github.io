I am an applied microeconomist at the University of Toronto, with appointments in the Department of Economics and Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. My research strives to improve urban transportation systems by focusing on three broad themes: first, understanding and addressing traffic congestion, second, evaluating the impacts of new transportation technologies on cities, and third, improving transportation safety. My research uses a variety of theoretical and empirical methods, including structural and reduced-form approaches, to address these themes. 

<!-- My research fields are environmental and resource economics, which means that I study the interactions between human and natural systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions like: 

- How do changes in environmental conditions affect the economy, and vice versa? 
- How should societies manage their natural resources when they are faced with uncertainty? 
- Do environmental policies function as intended, or are there unexpected consequences?

While there are important theoretical components to these questions, my work is mostly empirical. I rely on a mix of tools that includes classical econometrics, Bayesian methods, geospatial computation, and newer data science tools like machine learning. 

Alongside my regular research, I spend quite a lot time thinking about how to promote better coding practices among social scientists (including, most of all, myself). I am an advocate for open and reproducible science, as well as open-source software. You can find various materials along these lines on my website.
