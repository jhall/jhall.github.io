I am an applied microeconomist at the University of Alabama. My research strives to improve urban transportation systems by focusing on three broad themes: first, understanding and addressing traffic congestion, second, evaluating the impacts of new transportation technologies on cities, and third, improving transportation safety. My research uses a variety of theoretical and empirical methods, including structural and reduced-form approaches, to address these themes.
